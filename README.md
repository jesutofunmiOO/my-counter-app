This Application is my submission for Second Semester Examination @ Alt School of Engineering

This is a Counter App that contains a Custom hook where you can find 
increment, decrement, reset and a set value function.

It allows you to count upwards, decrease your count and also reset the count, perhaps you want to 
include your own value, there is an available set count option for you.

This App also include a manually generated invalid 404 error page that you can access from the 
Homepage or by using a wrong url in the application.

You also get to test the Error Boundary that is included in the App.
